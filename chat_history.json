You want to build an AI-powered mobile app that reads and summarizes fine print for consumers, highlighting key information and providing user-friendly explanations. Here's a plan to get started with a React Native + Expo app:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Core Functionality:** Implement a screen where users can input fine print text (either by uploading a document, taking a picture, or pasting text). The AI will then process the text and generate a summary.\n*   **Summary Display:** Create a clear and concise display of the summarized information, highlighting key terms, fees, obligations, and potential risks. Use bullet points and visual cues to improve readability.\n*   **User Preferences:** Allow users to set basic preferences for the type of information they want to prioritize (e.g., fees, cancellation policies).\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5F5` (Light gray)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray)\n    *   Primary: `#3F51B5` (Indigo)\n    *   Secondary: `#E91E63` (Pink)\n    *   Accent: `#00BCD4` (Cyan)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#FFEB3B` (Yellow)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" for a native look and feel.\n\n**Plan for Code Changes:**\n\n1.  **Create a new screen** for the fine print summarization feature. This screen will include:\n    *   Input methods (upload, camera, text paste).\n    *   AI processing logic (placeholder for now).\n    *   Summary display components.\n    *   User preference settings (basic).\n2.  **Modify the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` file:**\n    *   Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n    *   Add a button or link on the home screen that navigates to the new fine print summarization screen.\n3.  **Update `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`:**\n    *   Add a new tab for the fine print summarization feature, if desired.\n\nNow, I will instruct the coding agent to implement the plan and modify the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user. After that, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-06T01:43:28.661648"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build an AI-powered mobile app that reads and summarizes fine print for consumers.
